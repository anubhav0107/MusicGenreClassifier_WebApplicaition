# MusicGenreClassifier_WebApplicaition
A Flask based web application that recognizes the genre of a song using Machine Learning.

Music genre is a conventional category that identifies pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions.” 
The term “genre” is a subject to interpretation and it is often the case that genres may very fuzzy in their definition. 
Further, genres do not always have sound music theoretic foundations, e.g. - Indian genres are geographically defined, Baroque is classical music genre based on time period. 
Despite the lack of a standard criteria for defining genres, the classification of music based on genres is one of the broadest and most widely used. 
Genre usually assumes high weight in music recommender systems. Genre classification, till now, had been done manually by appending it to metadata of audio files or including it in album info. 
This project however aims at content-based classification, focusing on information within the audio rather than extraneously appended information. 
The traditional machine learning approach for classification is used - find suitable features of data, train classifier on feature data, make predictions. 
The novel thing that we have tried is the use of ensemble classifier on fundamentally different classifiers to achieve our end goal.
